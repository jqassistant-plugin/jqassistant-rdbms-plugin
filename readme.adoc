== Using the jqassistant-rdbms-plugin

NOTE:: Starting from jqassistant-rdbms-plugin v2.0.0, the RDBMS-Plugin resides under jqassistant-plugin.
Therefore, not only the repository location changed but also group id and artifact id were adapted from `com.buschmais.jqassistant.plugin:rdbms` to `org.jqassistant.plugin:jqassistant-rdbms-plugin`.

NOTE:: From jQAssistant v2.0.0 onwards, it is not part of the core distribution anymore and a manual configuration as shown below is required.
